## Step 4: Evaluate Differential Economic Impact on Individual EU Member States

### What I think:
Now I need to analyze how the 15% tariff will affect individual EU member states, focusing on those with high trade exposure to the US. This involves identifying their most vulnerable national industries.

### What I do:
I will use `google_web_search` to find reports and analyses on the economic impact of tariffs on Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, and the Netherlands, specifically looking for data on their trade exposure to the US and the vulnerability of their key industries.

### Source Search:
- `google_web_search` query: "economic impact of US tariffs on Germany trade exposure vulnerable industries"
- `google_web_search` query: "economic impact of US tariffs on France trade exposure vulnerable industries"
- `google_web_search` query: "economic impact of US tariffs on Ireland trade exposure vulnerable industries"
- `google_web_search` query: "economic impact of US tariffs on Italy trade exposure vulnerable industries"
- `google_web_search` query: "economic impact of US tariffs on Netherlands trade trade exposure vulnerable industries"

### Outcome:
Successfully gathered information on the differential economic impact of tariffs on Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, and the Netherlands. Updated `report.md` with detailed analysis for each country.

## Step 5: Research Macroeconomic Modeling Studies

### What I think:
I need to find macroeconomic modeling studies from economic think tanks and international organizations to quantify the potential effects on GDP growth, inflation rates, and overall trade volumes for both the US and the EU.

### What I do:
I will use `google_web_search` to find relevant studies and reports.

### Source Search:
- `google_web_search` query: "macroeconomic impact of US EU tariffs GDP inflation trade volume studies"
- `google_web_search` query: "economic models US EU trade war impact"
- `google_web_search` query: "IMF World Bank OECD report US EU tariffs economic impact"

### Outcome:

## Step 6: Investigate Long-Term Strategic Shifts in Global Trade and Supply Chains

### What I think:
Now I need to investigate the potential long-term strategic shifts in global trade and supply chains as a result of the tariff agreement. This includes exploring whether companies might relocate manufacturing and how the US and EU might pivot to new trade partners.

### What I do:
I will use `google_web_search` to find analyses and reports on:
- Supply chain restructuring due to tariffs (e.g., reshoring, nearshoring, friendshoring).
- Relocation of manufacturing facilities.
- Diversification of trade partners by the US and EU, particularly towards Asia-Pacific or South America.

## Step 8: Synthesize Findings and Critique Policy

### What I think:
This is the final step. I need to synthesize all the information gathered to provide a comprehensive overview of the agreement's impact. I will critique the policy by identifying the likely economic winners and losers, and speculate on the net long-term effect on the global economic and political order. The current conclusion in `report.md` is a good starting point, but I will refine it based on the detailed research.

### What I do:
I will review all the updated sections of `report.md` (Introduction, Sector-Specific Impacts US, Sector-Specific Impacts EU, Differential Economic Impact EU, Macroeconomic Modeling, Long-Term Strategic Shifts, Geopolitical Consequences). Based on this comprehensive review, I will refine and expand the "Conclusion: Winners, Losers, and the New Global Order" section to provide a more nuanced and detailed critique.

### Source Review:
- All previously gathered information and updated sections of `report.md`.

### Outcome:
Successfully synthesized all findings and refined the conclusion in `report.md` to provide a comprehensive overview and critique of the US-EU 15% tariff agreement, identifying economic winners and losers, and speculating on the net long-term effect on the global economic and political order.
