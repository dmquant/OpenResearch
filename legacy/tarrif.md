(1) Establish the context of the US-EU 15% tariff agreement by identifying the key goods and services traded between the two economic blocs and the main sectors involved in this trade relationship.
(2) Analyze the sector-specific impacts within the United States. For key industries like automotive, aerospace, technology, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals, investigate how a 15% tariff would affect production costs, consumer prices, corporate profitability, and employment.
(3) Conduct a parallel sector-specific analysis for the European Union, focusing on major export industries such as German automotive manufacturing, French luxury goods and aerospace, Italian machinery, and Irish pharmaceuticals.
(4) Evaluate the differential economic impact on individual EU member states, particularly those with high trade exposure to the US, including Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, and the Netherlands. Detail which national industries are most vulnerable.
(5) Research macroeconomic modeling studies from economic think tanks and international organizations to quantify the potential effects on GDP growth, inflation rates, and overall trade volumes for both the US and the EU.
(6) Investigate the potential long-term strategic shifts in global trade and supply chains. Explore whether companies might relocate manufacturing and how the US and EU might pivot to new trade partners in regions like Asia-Pacific or South America.
(7) Analyze the geopolitical consequences of such a tariff agreement, including its potential effects on the transatlantic political alliance, cooperation on international security, and the global standing of the WTO.
(8) Synthesize all findings to construct a comprehensive overview of the agreement's impact. Critique the policy by identifying the likely economic winners and losers, and speculate on the net long-term effect on the global economic and political order.
