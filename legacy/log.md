# Research Log

This log details the steps taken to generate the research report on the US-EU 15% tariff agreement.

## Step 1: Context of the US-EU Trade Relationship

I have gathered information on the key goods, services, and sectors involved in the US-EU trade relationship. 

**Key Findings:**

*   **Goods:** The main goods traded are pharmaceuticals, machinery, vehicles, energy (LNG), and chemicals.
*   **Services:** Key services include digital services, financial and consultancy services, transportation, and tourism.
*   **Sectors:** The most significant sectors are pharmaceuticals, automotive, aerospace, technology, agriculture, and energy.

This information establishes the context for analyzing the impact of a 15% tariff.

## Step 2: Sector-Specific Impacts in the United States

### Automotive Industry

A 15% tariff on imported automobiles is expected to have the following impacts:

*   **Consumer Prices:** Average vehicle prices could increase by $1,500 to $3,000.
*   **Production Costs:** Increased costs for both domestic and foreign automakers due to tariffs on imported parts.
*   **Corporate Profitability:** Profitability is likely to decrease due to higher costs and potentially lower sales.
*   **Employment:** The impact on employment is uncertain, with potential for both job losses due to decreased sales and job gains if manufacturing shifts to the US.
*   **Supply Chains:** Companies may be forced to re-evaluate and restructure their global supply chains.

### Aerospace Industry

A 15% tariff on imported aerospace components and products is expected to have the following impacts:

*   **Increased Production Costs:** Tariffs on raw materials (e.g., steel, aluminum) and imported components directly raise the cost of building aircraft, potentially increasing aircraft prices by over 10%.
*   **Supply Chain Disruptions:** The complex global supply chains will be disrupted, forcing companies to re-evaluate sourcing strategies.
*   **Market Uncertainty and Retaliation:** The instability created by tariffs can lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries, harming US aerospace exports.
*   **Restructuring and Competition:** Long-term tariffs could lead to industry restructuring, reduced investment in R&D, and increased competition.

## Plan from tarrif.md:

(1) Establish the context of the US-EU 15% tariff agreement by identifying the key goods and services traded between the two economic blocs and the main sectors involved in this trade relationship.
(2) Analyze the sector-specific impacts within the United States. For key industries like automotive, aerospace, technology, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals, investigate how a 15% tariff would affect production costs, consumer prices, corporate profitability, and employment.
(3) Conduct a parallel sector-specific analysis for the European Union, focusing on major export industries such as German automotive manufacturing, French luxury goods and aerospace, Italian machinery, and Irish pharmaceuticals.
(4) Evaluate the differential economic impact on individual EU member states, particularly those with high trade exposure to the US, including Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, and the Netherlands. Detail which national industries are most vulnerable.
(5) Research macroeconomic modeling studies from economic think tanks and international organizations to quantify the potential effects on GDP growth, inflation rates, and overall trade volumes for both the US and the EU.
(6) Investigate the potential long-term strategic shifts in global trade and supply chains. Explore whether companies might relocate manufacturing and how the US and EU might pivot to new trade partners in regions like Asia-Pacific or South America.
(7) Analyze the geopolitical consequences of such a tariff agreement, including its potential effects on the transatlantic political alliance, cooperation on international security, and the global standing of the WTO.
(8) Synthesize all findings to construct a comprehensive overview of the agreement's impact. Critique the policy by identifying the likely economic winners and losers, and speculate on the net long-term effect on the global economic and political order.
