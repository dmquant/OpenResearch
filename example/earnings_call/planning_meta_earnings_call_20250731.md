**Keyword:** meta_earnings_call
**Date:** 20250731

## Objective:
To conduct a comprehensive deep research on Meta's latest earnings call, covering key financial highlights, strategic insights, future outlook, and market reactions. The research will culminate in a detailed markdown report and a bilingual HTML visualization.

## Step 1: Information Gathering (Research Phase)

### 1.1 Identify the Latest Earnings Call:
*   **Action:** Determine the date and quarter of Meta's most recent earnings call.
*   **Tool:** `google_web_search` (e.g., "Meta latest earnings call date", "Meta Q2 2025 earnings call").

### 1.2 Obtain Earnings Call Transcript and Related Documents:
*   **Action:** Locate and access the official transcript, press release, and investor presentation for the identified earnings call.
*   **Tool:** `google_web_search` (e.g., "Meta Q2 2025 earnings call transcript", "Meta investor relations"). Prioritize official Meta Platforms Inc. sources (investor.fb.com or similar).

### 1.3 Analyze Financial Performance:
*   **Action:** Extract key financial metrics: revenue (total, by segment), net income, EPS, operating income, free cash flow, user growth (DAU, MAU for Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), and capital expenditures.
*   **Tool:** Read and parse the earnings call transcript and investor presentation.

### 1.4 Identify Strategic Highlights and Key Announcements:
*   **Action:** Pinpoint major announcements, strategic shifts, product updates, and significant investments discussed during the call (e.g., AI initiatives, metaverse developments, advertising trends, regulatory challenges).
*   **Tool:** Read and analyze the transcript, focusing on management commentary and Q&A sessions.

### 1.5 Understand Future Outlook and Guidance:
*   **Action:** Document Meta's forward-looking statements, revenue guidance, expense projections, and any other future-oriented commentary.
*   **Tool:** Read and analyze the transcript, specifically the outlook section and management's responses to analyst questions.

### 1.6 Assess Market and Analyst Reactions:
*   **Action:** Research how financial analysts and news outlets reacted to the earnings call (e.g., stock price movement, analyst ratings, key takeaways from financial news).
*   **Tool:** `google_web_search` (e.g., "Meta earnings call reaction", "analyst reports Meta Q2 2025").

## Step 2: Data Structuring and Report Composing

### 2.1 Outline Report Structure:
*   **Action:** Define sections for the markdown report: Executive Summary, Financial Highlights, Strategic Insights, Future Outlook, Market Reaction, and Appendix (Sources).

### 2.2 Populate Report Sections:
*   **Action:** Synthesize gathered information into concise, well-structured paragraphs and bullet points.
*   **Action:** Create tables for financial data where appropriate (e.g., revenue breakdown, user metrics).
*   **Action:** Ensure all claims are supported by data or direct quotes from the earnings call.

### 2.3 Include Sources:
*   **Action:** List all URLs of sources used in an "Appendix" section of the report.
*   **Action:** Integrate in-text citations or references where necessary.

## Step 3: Visualization (HTML Webpage)

### 3.1 Read Visualization Instructions:
*   **Action:** Read the `vis.md` file to understand the styling and layout requirements for the HTML webpage.
*   **Tool:** `read_file` for `/Users/daoming/prog/work/reports/deep/vis.md`.

### 3.2 Design Webpage Layout:
*   **Action:** Plan the layout of the bilingual webpage, ensuring a newspaper-like front page aesthetic. Consider sections for headlines, key financial figures, strategic summaries, and charts.

### 3.3 Implement Bilingual Content:
*   **Action:** Translate all key content (headlines, summaries, table headers, chart labels) into Simplified Chinese.

### 3.4 Create Data Visualizations:
*   **Action:** Design and implement charts (e.g., bar charts for revenue, line charts for user growth) using appropriate web technologies (e.g., JavaScript libraries like Chart.js or D3.js, or simple HTML/CSS for static representations if dynamic charts are not feasible within the tool's constraints).
*   **Constraint:** Pay close attention to avoiding "unstoppable extending height of chart axis" as per `instruct.md`.

### 3.5 Assemble HTML:
*   **Action:** Write the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (if dynamic charts are used) to create the `vis_meta_earnings_call_20250731.html` file.

## Step 4: Logging

### 4.1 Maintain a Detailed Log:
*   **Action:** Continuously record all steps taken, tools used, search queries, key findings, and any challenges encountered.
*   **Tool:** Append to `log_meta_earnings_call_20250731_[hhmmss].md` throughout the entire process.
