# Deep Research Report: ARM's Q1 FY26 Earnings Call (July 30, 2025)

## Executive Summary
ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ: ARM) reported its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 on July 30, 2025. The company's guidance for Q2 FY26 revenue and earnings per share (EPS) fell below analyst expectations, leading to a cautious outlook. This was primarily attributed to delayed customer shipments and delayed AI-accelerator licenses. Despite the near-term caution, ARM highlighted strong growth drivers in Custom Silicon Solutions (CSS) and increasing demand for AI compute on Arm-based platforms, along with strategic partnerships in data centers and IoT.

## Financial Highlights (Q1 FY26)

| Metric             | Q1 FY26 (Actual/Guidance) | Analyst Expectation | Variance | Source |
| :----------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------ | :------- | :----- |
| Total Revenue      | $1.05 billion             | $1.09 billion       | -$0.04B  | [1]    |
| EPS (Adjusted)     | $0.35                     | $0.42               | -$0.07   | [1]    |
| Royalty Revenue    | $599 million (projected)  | N/A                 | N/A      | [4]    |
| Royalty Revenue YoY| -28.3% (projected)        | N/A                 | N/A      | [4]    |

**Note:** The total revenue of $1.05 billion was reported as Arm's second consecutive quarter over $1 billion and its best Q1 ever [2]. However, the guidance for Q2 FY26 revenue is between $1.01 billion and $1.11 billion, with royalty and licensing revenues anticipated to be flat sequentially [2].

## Strategic Updates & Business Segments

ARM is experiencing robust growth driven by the widespread adoption of its Custom Silicon Solutions (CSS) and the escalating demand for AI compute on Arm-based platforms. The company is actively focused on delivering advanced solutions to enable leading technology companies to leverage AI capabilities [2].

Key market trends impacting ARM include: AI, data centers, automotive, and IoT. There's a notable trend towards further integration, particularly with newer customers such as Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) [2].

Strategic partnerships with major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google are emphasizing the role of Armv9 in energy-efficient data centers and the expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) markets [3].

While specific R&D investment figures were not detailed in the available summaries, the company's focus on new technologies and AI implies significant ongoing investment in these areas.

## Management Commentary

CEO Rene Haas and CFO Jason Child participated in the earnings call. The management's commentary conveyed a cautious outlook for the upcoming quarter. This caution is primarily attributed to two factors: delayed customer shipments and delayed AI-accelerator licenses [7].

Despite the near-term headwinds, management remains confident in the long-term growth trajectory, driven by strong customer design pipelines and rising demand for Arm's technology across various sectors. However, the company is not providing full-year guidance due to prevailing macroeconomic uncertainties [5].

## Analyst Q&A Insights

A full transcript of the analyst Q&A session is expected to be available soon. Preliminary reports indicate that discussions revolved around the revenue miss and the soft guidance for Q2 FY26. Analysts likely probed into the specifics of delayed shipments and AI-accelerator licenses, as well as the broader macroeconomic impact on ARM's business. The company's stance on not providing full-year guidance due to macroeconomic uncertainties was also a key point of discussion [5].

## Market Reaction & Analyst Sentiment

Following the Q1 FY26 earnings report, ARM's stock experienced a decline. This negative market reaction was primarily due to the reported revenue miss and the cautious guidance provided for the upcoming quarter [6]. The soft guidance, particularly concerning royalty revenue, likely contributed to investor apprehension.

## Competitive Landscape Comparison

ARM operates in a highly competitive landscape, vying with industry giants like Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm across various computing segments:

*   **ARM:** Increasingly challenging Intel and AMD in enterprise computing, powering data centers and AI workloads due to its power efficiency. Significant progress in the PC market (Apple, Qualcomm) and crucial for AI-specific ASICs (Google TPUs, AWS Graviton) [8].
*   **Intel:** Competing with AMD in desktop and server CPUs. Undergoing restructuring [9].
*   **AMD:** Strong competitor to Intel in CPUs and to Nvidia in data center computing [10].
*   **Nvidia:** Dominant in data center GPUs (90% market share) with its CUDA ecosystem. Planning ARM-based CPUs for PC AI in 2025-2026 [11].
*   **Qualcomm:** Strong contender in laptop CPUs with ARM-based Snapdragon X Elite processors, showing strong performance against Intel and AMD [12].

Recent earnings from competitors:

*   **Intel (Q2 2025):** Revenue $12.9B (flat YoY), GAAP EPS $(0.67), non-GAAP EPS $(0.10) (missed estimates due to restructuring) [9].
*   **AMD (Q1 2025):** Revenue $7.4B (+35.9% YoY), diluted EPS $0.44 (GAAP), $0.96 (non-GAAP) (surpassed estimates, driven by Data Center and Client segments) [13].
*   **Nvidia (Q1 FY26):** Revenue $44.1B (+69% YoY), Data Center segment $39.1B (+73% YoY) [14].
*   **Qualcomm (Q3 FY25):** Revenue $10.4B (+10% YoY), GAAP EPS $2.43, non-GAAP EPS $2.77 (exceeded expectations, driven by QCT Automotive and IoT) [15].

ARM's cautious outlook contrasts with the strong performance of some competitors like AMD and Nvidia, highlighting the specific challenges ARM faces with delayed shipments and licenses, despite its strong long-term positioning in AI and data centers.

## Future Outlook

ARM's future outlook is characterized by both opportunities and near-term challenges. The company is not providing full-year guidance due to macroeconomic uncertainties, indicating a degree of caution. However, management remains confident in healthy growth driven by robust customer design pipelines and increasing demand for Arm's technology.

**Opportunities:**
*   **AI Compute:** Continued strong demand for AI compute on Arm-based platforms is a significant growth driver.
*   **Custom Silicon Solutions (CSS):** Widespread adoption of CSS is expected to contribute to revenue growth.
*   **Strategic Partnerships:** Collaborations with major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google) for energy-efficient data centers and IoT expansion are key to long-term growth.
*   **Emerging Markets:** Automotive and IoT continue to be important growth areas.

**Risks:**
*   **Macroeconomic Uncertainties:** The primary reason for not providing full-year guidance, indicating potential volatility.
*   **Delayed Customer Shipments:** A near-term headwind impacting revenue.
*   **Delayed AI-Accelerator Licenses:** Another factor contributing to the cautious short-term outlook.
*   **Competitive Pressure:** Intense competition from Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm across various segments.

## Conclusion

ARM's Q1 FY26 earnings call presented a mixed picture. While the company's guidance for the upcoming quarter was cautious due to specific operational delays and macroeconomic uncertainties, the underlying strategic positioning in high-growth areas like AI, data centers, and IoT remains strong. The continued adoption of Custom Silicon Solutions and strategic partnerships are expected to drive long-term growth. Investors will be closely watching for signs of recovery in customer shipments and AI-accelerator licensing in the coming quarters.
