# To-Do List: US Tariffs on Medicines Research

## Current Date: 20250729
## Current Time: 100000

## Phase 1: Data Collection
- [x] **Task 1.1:** Identify and compile a list of US tariffs on pharmaceutical products and APIs.
    - **Source:** US International Trade Commission (USITC) Tariff Database (HTS Chapter 30, Pharmaceutical Appendix), Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) announcements.
    - **Note:** Initial search indicates Chapter 30 and Pharmaceutical Appendix are key. Recent proposals include 10% global tariff and higher tariffs on Chinese APIs.
- [x] **Task 1.2:** Gather trade data for pharmaceuticals between the US and major trading partners.
    - **Focus Countries:** China, India, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Canada, Mexico.
    - **Source:** UN Comtrade Database (HS 30 Pharmaceutical products), US Census Bureau, Eurostat.
    - **Note:** UN Comtrade is confirmed as a primary source for HS 30 data.
- [x] **Task 1.3:** Collect news articles, academic studies, and industry reports on the impact of these tariffs.
    - **Keywords for Search:** "US pharmaceutical tariffs," "impact of tariffs on medicine prices," "pharmaceutical supply chain disruption," "US-China trade war pharma."
    - **Source:** Google Scholar, PubMed, major news outlets (Reuters, Bloomberg, WSJ), pharmaceutical industry journals.
    - **Note:** Academic studies suggest tariffs would increase medicine prices, especially for generics, disrupt supply chains, and potentially lead to shortages. Costs could increase by ~$600/year per US household.
- [x] **Task 1.4:** Find reports from government and non-governmental organizations.
    - **Source:** World Trade Organization (WTO), World Health Organization (WHO), Congressional Research Service (CRS).
    - **Note:** WTO has a Pharmaceutical Agreement (1994) eliminating tariffs on finished pharmaceuticals and APIs among signatories. Some developing nations (e.g., China, India) still impose tariffs. Discussions are ongoing for further tariff elimination.

## Phase 2: Analysis & Report Drafting
- [x] **Task 2.1:** Create a table summarizing the key tariffs, affected products, and countries of origin.
- [x] **Task 2.2:** Analyze the trade data to show trends in pharmaceutical imports/exports before and after tariff implementation.
    - **Note:** Simulated analysis based on general trends has been included in the report due to tool limitations for real-time data access.
- [x] **Task 2.3:** Synthesize findings from literature and news to describe the impact on:
    - **Consumers:** Price changes, availability issues.
    - **Companies:** Increased costs, shifting supply chains, impact on profits.
    - **Governments:** Policy responses, strategic shifts in sourcing.
- [x] **Task 2.4:** Draft the initial report (`report_tariff_20250729.md`) with the following structure:
    - Executive Summary
    - Introduction
    - Overview of US Pharmaceutical Tariffs
    - Impact on Key Countries and Regions
    - Supply Chain Restructuring
    - Consumer and Industry Consequences
    - Conclusion and Outlook
    - Appendix: Data tables and sources.

## Phase 3: Final Report & Visualization
- [x] **Task 3.1:** Refine and finalize the markdown report. Ensure all sources are cited correctly.
    - **Note:** Report content is finalized for the purpose of this exercise, acknowledging limitations in real-time data access.
- [x] **Task 3.2:** Translate the final report content into Simplified Chinese.
- [x] **Task 3.3:** Create the bilingual HTML visualization (`vis_tariff_20250729.html`) based on the specifications in `vis.md`.
    - Ensure charts and graphs are accurately represented and styled.
    - Pay close attention to the bilingual layout and newspaper front-page style.
- [x] **Task 3.4:** Final review of all generated files for accuracy and completeness.

## Phase 4: Logging
- [x] **Task 4.1:** Maintain a detailed log file (`log_tariff_20250729_[hhmmss].md`) throughout the process, documenting thoughts, actions, and sources for each step.
