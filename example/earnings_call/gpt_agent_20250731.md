  **Dow Jones       **44,461.28**     ▼ 0.38%           Slipped 171 points after the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged and Chair Jerome Powell signaled the Fed is not ready to cut rates; investors reacted to stronger‑than‑expected GDP data and the
  Industrial                                            prospect of higher tariffs[\[1\]](https://www.reuters.com/business/equities-retreat-powell-dampens-fed-sept-cut-hopes-2025-07-30/#:~:text=,rate%20cut%20fall%20below%2050).

  **S&P 500**       **6,362.90**      ▼ 0.12%           Pulled back after rising as much as 0.4% intraday; materials sector underperformed as copper tariffs sank Freeport‑McMoRan

  **Nasdaq          **21,129.67**     ▲ 0.15%           Benefited from strength in tech and AI stocks; after‑market gains from Microsoft and Meta drove

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Context:** The S&P 500 and Nasdaq had reached record highs in the
prior sessions; however, the July 30 session saw profit‑taking and a
cautious reaction to the Fed's message. Rate‑cut expectations for
September fell below 50% after Powell's
comments[\[4\]](https://www.reuters.com/business/equities-retreat-powell-dampens-fed-sept-cut-hopes-2025-07-30/#:~:text=After%20market%20expectations%20for%20a,according%20to%20the%20LSEG%20data).
Prior to July 30, the S&P 500 had snapped a six‑day record streak on
July 29 (down 0.3%) while the Nasdaq ended a four‑session run
(down 0.4%)[\[5\]](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-07292025-11780754#:~:text=Parcel%20Service%20%20,advancers%20in%20the%20benchmark%20index).

  **Gold (spot)**             \~\$3,273.59/oz         Fell **1.58%** after the Fed decision and strong GDP data, extending recent
                                                      losses[\[8\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-6-graphic-2025-07-30/#:~:text=Elsewhere%20in%20commodities%2C%20gold%20prices,economic%20data). Gold had risen

  **Copper (Comex futures)**  Plunged nearly **20%**  Trump's unexpected 50% tariff on copper products triggered a drop of \~19.5% in U.S. Comex copper

                                                      this weighed on the S&P 500 materials

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Factors Driving Market Moves

- **Federal Reserve policy:** The Fed kept the federal‑funds target
  range at **4.25 -- 4.50%** and maintained the **interest rate on
  reserve balances at
  4.4%**[\[11\]](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250730a1.htm#:~:text=maintain%20the%20interest%20rate%20paid,the%20following%20domestic%20policy%20directive).
  Powell emphasised that the labour market remains strong but inflation
  is still above target, so the Fed is **"in no rush to cut
  rates"**[\[12\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-trading-day-2025-07-30/#:~:text=The%20overarching%20message%20that%20investors,two%20policymakers%20to%20do%20so).
  The cautious tone caused rate‑cut expectations for September to drop
  below
  50%[\[4\]](https://www.reuters.com/business/equities-retreat-powell-dampens-fed-sept-cut-hopes-2025-07-30/#:~:text=After%20market%20expectations%20for%20a,according%20to%20the%20LSEG%20data).

- **Economic data:** Advance GDP for Q2 showed the U.S. economy grew at
  an **annualised 3.0%**, beating the consensus
  (2.4%)[\[13\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-trading-day-2025-07-30/#:~:text=On%20the%20economy%2C%20Powell%20said,this%20looks%20nothing%20but%20bullish).
  However, the underlying measure of domestic demand grew at its slowest
  pace since
  2022[\[14\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-trading-day-2025-07-30/#:~:text=On%20the%20economy%2C%20Powell%20said,this%20looks%20nothing%20but%20bullish).
  Strong ADP payrolls (104k vs 75k expected) reinforced the view of a
  resilient labour
  market[\[15\]](https://www.reuters.com/business/equities-retreat-powell-dampens-fed-sept-cut-hopes-2025-07-30/#:~:text=Earlier%20data%20in%20the%20ADP,before%20Friday%27s%20government%20payrolls%20report).

- **Tariff uncertainty:** President Trump's trade policy remained a
  major overhang. He announced **50% tariffs on certain copper
  products** and other goods, which hammered copper
  prices[\[16\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-6-graphic-2025-07-30/#:~:text=Meanwhile%20on%20the%20trade%20front%2C,financial%20benefit%20from%20the%20tariff)
  and weighed on materials
  stocks[\[10\]](https://www.reuters.com/business/equities-retreat-powell-dampens-fed-sept-cut-hopes-2025-07-30/#:~:text=The%20tariff%20weighed%20heavily%20on,5).
  An Aug. 1 deadline looms for tariffs on Canada, Mexico, the EU and
  other partners; negotiations are
  ongoing[\[17\]](https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-markets-this-week-fed-meeting-tariffs-deadline-july-jobs-report-11778358#:~:text=Investors%20Focus%20on%20the%20Fed%2C,Deadline%2C%20Jobs%20Report%2C%20Inflation%20Data).

- **Corporate earnings:** The reporting season produced mixed results.
  Mega‑cap tech companies (the "Magnificent 7") hold enormous weight in
  indices, so investors awaited results from Microsoft, Meta, Apple and
  Amazon[\[18\]](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-07292025-11780754#:~:text=Mega,on%20Wednesday%2C%20while%20Apple%20and).
  Strong after‑hours results from Microsoft and Meta on July 30 sent
  their shares up 8% and 9%,
  respectively[\[19\]](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/microsoft-meta-fuel-500-billion-gain-ai-stocks-2025-07-30/#:~:text=In%20extended%20trade%2C%20Microsoft%20jumped,billion%20and%20%24152%20billion%2C%20respectively).
  Conversely, several industrial and consumer companies issued weak
  guidance---UPS withdrew its outlook and dropped over 10%, while
  Carrier and Brown & Brown both fell around
  10%[\[20\]](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-07292025-11780754#:~:text=about%202,advancers%20in%20the%20benchmark%20index).

- **Dollar and bond yields:** The dollar index surged to a two‑month
  high (up \~1%), while U.S. Treasury yields rose, reflecting diminished
  expectations for near‑term rate
  cuts[\[21\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-trading-day-2025-07-30/#:~:text=Today%27s%20Key%20Market%20Moves).

### 4.2 Bank stocks

Recent earnings from major U.S. banks (JPMorgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo)
showed mixed reactions:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Bank                                Key results and market reaction
  ----------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **JPMorgan Chase**                  Beat profit expectations thanks to robust investment‑banking fees but cautioned about tariffs; shares fell **\~0.7%** following
                                      results[\[27\]](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-banking-giants-reap-gains-dealmaking-rebound-2025-07-15/#:~:text=JPMorgan%20Chase%20%28JPM,health%20of%20consumers%20and%20businesses).

  **Citigroup**                       Earnings topped forecasts and the bank announced a **\$4 billion share buyback**; shares **rose
                                      \~5%**[\[27\]](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-banking-giants-reap-gains-dealmaking-rebound-2025-07-15/#:~:text=JPMorgan%20Chase%20%28JPM,health%20of%20consumers%20and%20businesses).

  **Wells Fargo**                     Despite beating profits, the bank **cut its net‑interest‑income outlook**, causing shares to drop
                                      **6.3%**[\[27\]](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-banking-giants-reap-gains-dealmaking-rebound-2025-07-15/#:~:text=JPMorgan%20Chase%20%28JPM,health%20of%20consumers%20and%20businesses).
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, investors remained wary of banks because higher tariffs and
potential economic slowdown could hurt loan growth and trading revenue.

### 4.3 Consumer‑related stocks and industrials

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Company/Sector                      Reaction & reasons
  ----------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **United Parcel Service (UPS)**     Shares **tumbled more than 10%** after earnings; revenue slightly beat estimates but earnings missed. UPS withheld a full‑year outlook due to macro‑economic uncertainty and trade‑policy

## 7. Short‑Term Outlook and Predictions

- **Interest‑rate outlook:** Powell's comments suggest the Fed is
  comfortable keeping policy "modestly restrictive" and will wait for
  clear evidence of slowing inflation before cutting. Markets now see a
  cut more likely in **December** than
  September[\[36\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-trading-day-2025-07-30/#:~:text=The%20overarching%20message%20that%20investors,two%20policymakers%20to%20do%20so).
  Short‑term yields may remain elevated, supporting the dollar and
  pressuring rate‑sensitive sectors (real estate, utilities).

- **Economic data sensitivity:** With Q2 GDP headline growth masking
  weak domestic demand and PCE inflation still above
  target[\[14\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-trading-day-2025-07-30/#:~:text=On%20the%20economy%2C%20Powell%20said,this%20looks%20nothing%20but%20bullish),
  upcoming PCE and jobs data will be critical. A softening in employment
  or inflation could revive rate‑cut hopes; stronger data could push
  yields higher.

- **Tariff uncertainty:** Negotiations ahead of the Aug 1 deadline and
  Trump's unpredictable tariff announcements introduce significant
  headline risk. New levies on copper already jolted materials stocks,
  and additional tariffs on trading partners could hit consumer and
  industrial companies.

- **Earnings dispersion:** So far, tech and AI‑related firms have
  delivered robust results, while industrials and consumer discretionary
  names have disappointed. This divergence is likely to continue.
  Positive surprises from Apple and Amazon could support the Nasdaq,
  while weak reports could prompt broader profit‑taking.

- **Cryptocurrency sentiment:** Bitcoin and Ethereum remain near record
  highs but show increased volatility around macro‑events. Institutional
  inflows and regulatory developments (such as spot‑ETF approvals) may
  keep crypto prices supported, yet they remain sensitive to risk‑off
  episodes and changes in monetary policy.

- **Overall market sentiment:** After an extended rally, U.S. stocks
  show signs of consolidation. High valuations and rising bond yields
  leave equities vulnerable to earnings misses or macro‑shocks. However,
  continued strength in AI and the resilience of consumer spending
  provide underlying support. Expect **choppy trading with a modest
  upward bias** contingent on data and policy signals.
