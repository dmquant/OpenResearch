# Planning for Deep Research: Impacts to Pharmaceuticals of US Tariffs for Other Countries

## Step 1: Planning (Current Step)
- **Objective:** Create a detailed to-do list for researching the impacts of US tariffs on pharmaceuticals from other countries.
- **Output:** `planning_tariff_20250728.md` (this file)

## Step 2: Iteration of the Planning
1. **Create Task List:**
    - Read `planning_tariff_20250728.md`.
    - Create `task_tariff_20250728_[hhmmss].md` with a detailed, actionable to-do list for research agents.
2. **Execute Research Tasks (Iterative Process):**
    - **Task 2.1: Understand the Scope and Key Players:**
        - Define "US tariffs" in the context of pharmaceuticals (e.g., specific acts, trade wars, general tariff policies).
        - Identify "other countries" most affected or relevant to pharmaceutical trade with the US (e.g., China, India, EU, Canada, Mexico).
        - Identify key pharmaceutical products/categories that might be impacted.
        - Research the current state of the global pharmaceutical supply chain.
    - **Task 2.2: Identify Existing Tariffs and Their Application:**
        - Search for specific US tariffs imposed on pharmaceutical products or related raw materials/components from identified countries.
        - Determine the effective dates and duration of these tariffs.
        - Investigate any retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on US pharmaceutical exports.
    - **Task 2.3: Analyze Economic Impacts:**
        - **For US Consumers/Patients:**
            - Impact on drug prices (increase/decrease).
            - Impact on drug availability/shortages.
            - Impact on innovation and R&D within the US.
        - **For US Pharmaceutical Companies:**
            - Impact on manufacturing costs (if raw materials are imported).
            - Impact on export competitiveness.
            - Impact on supply chain resilience and diversification strategies.
            - Impact on investment decisions (e.g., reshoring, nearshoring).
        - **For Pharmaceutical Companies in Other Countries:**
            - Impact on export volumes to the US.
            - Impact on profitability and market share.
            - Strategies adopted (e.g., finding new markets, reducing costs, shifting production).
        - **For Global Pharmaceutical Supply Chain:**
            - Diversification of supply sources.
            - Regionalization of manufacturing.
            - Changes in trade flows.
    - **Task 2.4: Analyze Non-Economic Impacts:**
        - **Geopolitical Implications:**
            - Impact on trade relations between the US and other countries.
            - Potential for trade disputes and their resolution.
        - **Regulatory and Quality Control:**
            - How tariffs might affect regulatory compliance and quality standards if supply chains shift.
        - **Public Health Implications:**
            - Long-term effects on global health security and access to essential medicines.
    - **Task 2.5: Gather Data and Case Studies:**
        - Collect relevant economic data (e.g., trade volumes, price indices, import/export figures).
        - Look for specific case studies of pharmaceutical companies or products affected by tariffs.
        - Utilize recent news articles, academic papers, industry reports, and government publications.
    - **Task 2.6: Identify Future Trends and Outlook:**
        - Forecast potential future tariff policies.
        - Analyze long-term implications for the pharmaceutical industry.
        - Identify potential mitigation strategies or policy recommendations.
3. **Update Task List:** Recursively update `task_tariff_20250728_[hhmmss].md` after each sub-task, ticking off completed items and appending new ones if necessary.
4. **Utilize Recent Information:** Prioritize news, events, and data from 2023-2025.

## Step 3: Report Composing
- **Objective:** Compile all gathered information into a comprehensive report.
- **Output:** `report_tariff_20250728.md`
- **Content Requirements:**
    - Markdown format.
    - Use tables for data presentation where appropriate.
    - Include sources both in the content (citations) and in an appendix (bibliography).

## Step 4: Report Visualization
- **Objective:** Create a bilingual (English and Simplified Chinese) webpage visualization of the report.
- **Output:** `vis_tariff_20250728.html`
- **Style Instructions:** Refer to `vis.md` for styling guidelines.
- **Key Consideration:** Ensure charts avoid unstoppable extending height of chart axis.

## Logging
- **Objective:** Maintain a detailed log of all actions, thoughts, and sources.
- **Output:** `log_tariff_20250728_[hhmmss].md` (continuously updated throughout the process).
