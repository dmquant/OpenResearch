## To-Do List (Generated: 2025-07-28 14:30:22)

### Step 2.1: Understand the Scope and Key Players
- [x] Define "US tariffs" in the context of pharmaceuticals (e.g., specific acts, trade wars, general tariff policies).
- [x] Identify "other countries" most affected or relevant to pharmaceutical trade with the US (e.g., China, India, EU, Canada, Mexico).
- [x] Identify key pharmaceutical products/categories that might be impacted.
- [x] Research the current state of the global pharmaceutical supply chain.

### Step 2.2: Identify Existing Tariffs and Their Application
- [x] Search for specific US tariffs imposed on pharmaceutical products or related raw materials/components from identified countries.
- [x] Determine the effective dates and duration of these tariffs.
- [x] Investigate any retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on US pharmaceutical exports.

### Step 2.3: Analyze Economic Impacts
- [ ] **For US Consumers/Patients:**
    - [x] Impact on drug prices (increase/decrease).
    - [x] Impact on drug availability/shortages.
    - [x] Impact on innovation and R&D within the US.
- [ ] **For US Pharmaceutical Companies:**
    - [x] Impact on manufacturing costs (if raw materials are imported).
    - [x] Impact on export competitiveness.
    - [x] Impact on supply chain resilience and diversification strategies.
    - [x] Impact on investment decisions (e.g., reshoring, nearshoring).
- [ ] **For Pharmaceutical Companies in Other Countries:**
    - [x] Impact on export volumes to the US.
    - [x] Impact on profitability and market share.
    - [x] Strategies adopted (e.g., finding new markets, reducing costs, shifting production).
- [ ] **For Global Pharmaceutical Supply Chain:**
    - [x] Diversification of supply sources.
    - [x] Regionalization of manufacturing.
    - [x] Changes in trade flows.

### Step 2.4: Analyze Non-Economic Impacts
- [ ] **Geopolitical Implications:**
    - [x] Impact on trade relations between the US and other countries.
    - [ ] Potential for trade disputes and their resolution.
- [ ] **Regulatory and Quality Control:**
    - [x] How tariffs might affect regulatory compliance and quality standards if supply chains shift.
- [ ] **Public Health Implications:**
    - [x] Long-term effects on global health security and access to essential medicines.

### Step 2.5: Gather Data and Case Studies
- [ ] Collect relevant economic data (e.g., trade volumes, price indices, import/export figures).
- [ ] Look for specific case studies of pharmaceutical companies or products affected by tariffs.
- [ ] Utilize recent news articles, academic papers, industry reports, and government publications.

### Step 2.6: Identify Future Trends and Outlook
- [x] Forecast potential future tariff policies.
- [x] Analyze long-term implications for the pharmaceutical industry.
- [x] Identify potential mitigation strategies or policy recommendations.
