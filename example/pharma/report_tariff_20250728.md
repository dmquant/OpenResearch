# Report: Impacts to Pharmaceuticals of US Tariffs for Other Countries

## Executive Summary
US tariffs on pharmaceutical products and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) have significant and multifaceted impacts on global trade, supply chains, and public health. While primarily aimed at incentivizing domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign sources, these tariffs lead to increased drug prices, potential shortages, and complex geopolitical challenges. Key countries like China and India, major suppliers of APIs and generic drugs, are particularly affected, leading to shifts in their export volumes, profitability, and market strategies. The long-term implications include a push towards regionalization of manufacturing, but also increased costs for consumers and potential hindrances to pharmaceutical innovation.

## 1. Introduction to US Tariffs in Pharmaceuticals
US tariffs on pharmaceuticals are taxes imposed by the US government on imported pharmaceutical products and ingredients. The stated goals are to increase the cost of foreign-made drugs, encourage domestic manufacturing, reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, and potentially lower drug prices by stimulating domestic competition. Historically, tariffs on pharmaceuticals have been low, but recent proposals and implementations suggest significant increases, ranging from 7.5% to as high as 200% on certain products and APIs.

## 2. Key Countries and Products Impacted

### 2.1. Major Pharmaceutical Trading Partners with the US

| Category | Key Countries (by Value) | Key Countries (by Volume/Weight - APIs & Generics) |
|---|---|---|
| **US Imports** | Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, Singapore, India, Belgium, Italy, UK, Japan (EU collectively 62%) | China (23% by weight, dominant for ibuprofen, acetaminophen), India (major for generics, relies on China for APIs), Mexico |

### 2.2. Key Pharmaceutical Products and Categories Impacted
Generic drugs and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are highly impacted, accounting for approximately 90% of US prescriptions. Specific examples of products heavily reliant on imports, particularly from China, include:

*   **Ibuprofen:** 95% from China
*   **Hydrocortisone:** 91% from China
*   **Acetaminophen:** 70% from China
*   **Penicillin:** 40-45% from China
*   **Heparin:** 40% from China
*   **Overall Antibiotics:** 80% from China

Other globally important APIs include Paracetamol, Amoxicillin, Atorvastatin, Metformin, Omeprazole, and Amlodipine.

## 3. Existing Tariffs and Their Application

### 3.1. Specific US Tariffs on Pharmaceutical Products and Raw Materials
*   **China:** The US applies a baseline 10% tariff, with additional Section 301 tariffs. While finished pharmaceuticals and APIs were largely exempt from broader reciprocal tariffs, consistent threats of significant tariffs (7.5-200%) exist. A specific 20% "fentanyl" tariff has been imposed on certain Chinese goods. New tariffs (25-100%) on medical supplies (respirators, facemasks, syringes, needles, medical gloves) are effective from September 27, 2024, January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2026.
*   **India:** The US has largely exempted pharmaceutical products from India from broader tariffs (10% universal, 26% discounted on Indian goods) due to India's significant role in supplying affordable generic medicines (40% of US generics). However, discussions and threats of substantial tariffs (up to 200%) to encourage US domestic manufacturing persist.

### 3.2. Retaliatory Tariffs by Other Countries
*   **China:** China has implemented retaliatory tariffs on US pharmaceuticals, with some as high as 125% (e.g., cancer therapies, diabetes medications). Reports also indicate a 34% levy on all US imports. This impacts US-manufactured drugs sold in China.
*   **India:** India has largely spared pharmaceutical products from new reciprocal tariffs, but the US has imposed 26-27% reciprocal tariffs on Indian medical device exports. India imposes up to 10% import duties on US drugs and is exploring protective measures for its pharmaceutical sector, including potentially lowering tariffs on US medical devices to mitigate threats.

## 4. Economic Impacts

### 4.1. Impacts on US Consumers/Patients
*   **Drug Prices:** Tariffs are expected to lead to higher drug prices. A proposed 25% tariff could increase US drug prices by nearly $51 billion annually, potentially raising costs by up to 12.9%. This is due to increased production costs for manufacturers, especially generic drug manufacturers who rely heavily on imported APIs and operate on thin margins. Higher drug costs could also lead to increased health insurance premiums and taxes.
*   **Drug Availability/Shortages:** Tariffs are widely predicted to cause or exacerbate drug shortages. Increased production costs for generic drug manufacturers may force them to exit the market or discontinue products. Tariffs disrupt the flow of essential raw materials, APIs, and finished medications, leading to bottlenecks and delays, especially for critical generic medicines. Reshoring manufacturing requires substantial time and investment, which is challenging for generic drug manufacturers.
*   **Innovation and R&D:** Tariffs can increase R&D costs due to higher prices for imported APIs, raw materials, and equipment, potentially diverting funds from new drug discovery. This can delay innovation and drug development by hindering clinical trials and slowing down the R&D pipeline. While some larger companies might invest in US-based manufacturing and R&D to mitigate tariff risks, this requires substantial time and investment and may lead to higher production costs.

### 4.2. Impacts on US Pharmaceutical Companies
*   **Manufacturing Costs:** Tariffs directly increase the cost of imported raw materials, APIs, and components, leading to higher overall manufacturing expenses. This disproportionately affects generic drug manufacturers due to thin margins, potentially making production unprofitable and leading to market exit or product discontinuation. The industry faces uncertainty due to potential tariff increases and legal challenges.
*   **Export Competitiveness:** Tariffs can trigger retaliatory tariffs from other countries (e.g., China's 125% tariffs on US pharma exports), directly limiting export markets and making US products less competitive. Increased costs from tariffs on imported raw materials and APIs also make US-manufactured products more expensive globally. Tariffs can negatively impact R&D by diverting funds and creating uncertainty. This could lead to a shift in production away from the US, undermining reshoring goals.
*   **Supply Chain Resilience and Diversification:** Tariffs aim to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce foreign reliance, but introduce complexities. They increase costs and prices, and can cause supply chain disruptions and shortages. Strategies to enhance resilience include diversifying supply chains (away from China), domestic manufacturing/reshoring (though time-consuming and costly), cross-functional trade compliance planning, strategic partnerships, and technology adoption. Government intervention and policy alternatives are also crucial.
*   **Investment Decisions (Reshoring/Nearshoring):** US tariffs, particularly on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico (up to 25% on finished drugs and APIs), are a key driver for increased investment in pharmaceutical reshoring in the US. Major companies like Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, Roche, Novartis, J&J, Merck, AbbVie, and Amgen are making significant investments in US manufacturing and R&D facilities. These investments are also influenced by government initiatives (CHIPS Act, Inflation Reduction Act, Executive Orders, DPA) providing grants and tax credits. While encouraging reshoring, tariffs can lead to higher production costs and drug prices, especially for generics.

### 4.3. Impacts on Pharmaceutical Companies in Other Countries
*   **Export Volumes to the US:** For Chinese manufacturers, tariffs have led to squeezed profit margins and increased export costs, particularly for low-value-added products. This has resulted in reduced Chinese API exports to the US (e.g., a 24% year-on-year fall to $255 million in May 2025). Some Chinese firms may shift manufacturing to other Southeast Asian countries.
*   **Profitability and Market Share:**
    *   **China:** Tariffs squeeze profit margins for Chinese drug makers exporting to the US. Increased production costs due to tariffs on APIs (up to 245% on Chinese APIs in April 2025) directly impact profitability. Supply chain disruptions and potential relocation of production are also impacts. China's retaliatory tariffs further complicate the landscape. Some analysts suggest less impact on Chinese generic drug companies due to domestic focus.
    *   **India:** Tariffs would increase production costs for Indian manufacturers, making products less competitive and reducing profit margins, especially for low-cost generics. This could lead to revenue declines and job losses. Indian companies are exploring diversification into other markets (Europe, Africa), focusing on higher-margin products (complex generics, biosimilars), and investing in innovation. Some Indian companies with US manufacturing facilities may be cushioned.
*   **Strategies Adopted:** Chinese companies are adopting strategies such as supply chain diversification and localization (stockpiling US supplies, sourcing alternative raw materials, local testing), cost management, exploring overseas production/relocation (e.g., Southeast Asia, potentially US), innovation, new market development (Europe, "global South"), and strategic partnerships/investments.

### 4.4. Impacts on the Global Pharmaceutical Supply Chain
*   **Diversification of Supply Sources:** Tariffs increase costs and drug prices, and can cause supply chain disruptions. In response, companies are diversifying supply chains and reshoring production. This involves sourcing from non-tariffed regions (e.g., India, Germany) and shifting manufacturing closer to domestic markets. This strategy has challenges like coordinating fragmented operations and navigating regulatory volatility.
*   **Regionalization of Manufacturing:** Tariffs are driving regionalization/reshoring of pharmaceutical manufacturing, motivated by national security and reduced foreign reliance. Tariffs (25%+) aim to make imports expensive, incentivizing domestic production. Government initiatives (CHIPS Act, IRA) provide subsidies. This leads to increased costs, potential higher drug prices, and reshoring investments by major pharma companies. Reshoring is a long-term, capital-intensive process.
*   **Changes in Trade Flows:** Tariffs significantly impact global pharmaceutical trade flows by increasing costs, disrupting supply chains, and pushing for reshoring. While finished products were initially exempt, upstream components are subject to duties. This leads to higher production costs, potential drug shortages, and a push for domestic manufacturing. Uncertainty and volatility are high due to ongoing legal challenges and potential future tariffs. Retaliatory measures from other nations further complicate trade. Generic and biosimilar drugs are particularly vulnerable.

## 5. Non-Economic Impacts

### 5.1. Geopolitical Implications
*   **Trade Relations between the US and Other Countries:**
    *   **US-China:** US tariffs have significantly impacted US-China pharmaceutical trade relations, leading to increased costs, potential drug shortages, and a strategic shift in global supply chains. The US is heavily reliant on China for APIs. Both countries have imposed tariffs (US up to 245% on Chinese imports, China up to 125% on US pharma exports). Despite tensions, trade has grown for high-value goods.
    *   **US-India:** The US-India pharmaceutical trade relationship is significant, with India supplying ~40% of US generics. India imposes up to 10% import duty on US pharma. US has considered reciprocal tariffs (10%) and threatened higher (up to 200%). This could impact Indian pharma profitability and competitiveness, and lead to higher US healthcare costs and shortages. Both nations are negotiating a bilateral trade agreement based on reciprocity.

### 5.2. Regulatory and Quality Control
*   **Impact on Regulatory Compliance and Quality Standards:** Tariffs can significantly impact regulatory compliance by increasing costs and complexities. This includes higher compliance costs due to divergent trade policies and regulatory systems, increased focus on customs compliance (tariff classification, country of origin, valuation), and challenges in meeting FDA regulations when shifting supply routes. This can lead to delayed approvals and market entry for new treatments. For generic drug manufacturers, tariffs could force market exit, exacerbating shortages.

### 5.3. Public Health Implications
*   **Long-term Effects on Global Health Security and Access to Essential Medicines:** US tariffs on pharmaceuticals have significant impacts on global health security and access to essential medicines. They lead to increased costs and prices, supply chain disruptions, and limited access to medicines, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This can reduce innovation and R&D, and exacerbate global health inequities. While tariffs aim to encourage domestic manufacturing, reshoring is costly and long-term. The risk of retaliatory measures further fragments trade. Experts advocate for eliminating tariffs on medicines and APIs to enhance global access and health security.

## 6. Data and Case Studies

### 6.1. US Pharmaceutical Import/Export Data

| Year | US Pharmaceutical Imports (approx.) | US Pharmaceutical Exports (approx.) |
|---|---|---|
| **2023** | $170B - $208B | $100B - $156B |
| **2024** | $212B - $234B | $94.4B - $130B |
| **2025 (Projections/Early Figures)** | Projected to grow to $237.37B by 2028; surges in early 2025 due to stockpiling | Increases in early 2025 |

### 6.2. Case Studies of Pharmaceutical Companies Affected by Tariffs
Several major pharmaceutical companies have responded to US tariffs by investing in domestic manufacturing:

*   **AstraZeneca:** Committed $50 billion in US production, including a new manufacturing center in Virginia.
*   **Merck:** Invested over $12 billion since 2017 and plans an additional $9 billion by 2028 in US manufacturing/R&D.
*   **Roche:** Announced $50 billion investment in US manufacturing/R&D and increased inventories.
*   **Novartis:** Pledged $23 billion in US manufacturing efforts.
*   **Johnson & Johnson:** Plans to build four US plants with an investment exceeding $55 billion.
*   **Eli Lilly:** Manufacturing GLP-1 agonists like tirzepatide in US facilities.
*   **Sanofi and GSK:** Also established or expanded US manufacturing facilities.

These investments aim to mitigate tariff impacts and boost domestic production, but tariffs can still lead to higher drug prices, shortages, and negative R&D impacts.

## 7. Future Trends and Outlook

### 7.1. Forecast of Potential Future Tariff Policies
The US is actively pursuing significant tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals and APIs, with proposals ranging from 25% to 200%. Decisions regarding these tariffs could be announced as early as August 1, 2025. The primary motivations are to incentivize domestic drug manufacturing, create jobs, enhance national security, and address the US trade deficit. A federal court has ruled some "reciprocal tariffs" exceed presidential authority, but enforcement is on hold. The regulatory landscape for pharmaceutical imports is changing in 2025, with discussions around tiered tariff systems and increased enforcement.

### 7.2. Long-term Implications for the Pharmaceutical Industry
Long-term implications include increased drug prices, significant supply chain disruptions, and potential drug shortages. Tariffs can also hinder pharmaceutical innovation and R&D by increasing costs and diverting funds. There is a growing trend towards onshoring or nearshoring pharmaceutical production, but this is a long-term and capital-intensive process. Tariffs can also lead to retaliatory measures from other nations, creating lasting uncertainty for investors and R&D partnerships.

### 7.3. Potential Mitigation Strategies and Policy Recommendations
Pharmaceutical companies are developing various mitigation strategies:

*   **Supply Chain Diversification and Localization:** Reducing reliance on single-source suppliers, expanding US-based production, and diversifying API sourcing to non-tariffed regions.
*   **Financial Mitigation and Pricing Strategies:** Implementing cost-efficiency programs, reprioritizing capital expenditures, exploring insurance/hedging, using transfer pricing, adjusting inventory levels, and leveraging Foreign Trade Zones.
*   **Stakeholder Engagement and Advocacy:** Engaging with industry associations to advocate for exemptions, collaborating with regulatory bodies, and communicating with customers.
*   **Strategic Planning and Analysis:** Mapping tariff exposure, scenario planning, reassessing global sourcing, and staying informed about policies.
*   **Operational Adjustments:** Evaluating alternative suppliers, increasing safety stock, and ensuring correct country of origin declarations.

Experts often advocate for the elimination of tariffs on medicines and APIs to enhance global access and ensure health security. Alternative policy options, such as direct investment in domestic industrial base expansion, tax policy changes, and reimbursement reform, might be more effective and have fewer unintended consequences than broad tariffs.
