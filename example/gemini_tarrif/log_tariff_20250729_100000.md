# Log: US Tariffs on Medicines Research (20250729_100000)

## Start Time: 20250729_100000

## Step 1: Planning
- **Action:** Created `planning_tariff_20250729.md` based on the user's prompt and `instruct.md`.
- **Thought:** The plan outlines a comprehensive research approach, covering data collection, analysis, report drafting, and visualization. It also identifies key sources and potential challenges (e.g., real-time data access).

## Step 2: Iteration of the planning

### Iteration 1
- **Action:** Created `task_tariff_20250729_100000.md` from the planning document.
- **Thought:** This task list will guide the research process and allow for tracking progress.

### Iteration 2 (Task 1.1: Identify and compile US tariffs)
- **Action:** Performed Google Web Search for "USITC Tariff Database pharmaceutical products".
- **Source:** 
    - https://usitc.gov
    - https://flexport.com
    - https://delveinsight.com
    - https://constructiondive.com
- **Thought:** The search results confirmed that the USITC Tariff Database (HTS Chapter 30 and Pharmaceutical Appendix) is the primary source for US tariffs on pharmaceuticals. It also highlighted recent proposals for a 10% global tariff and higher tariffs on Chinese APIs. Updated `task_tariff_20250729_100000.md`.

### Iteration 3 (Task 1.2: Gather trade data)
- **Action:** Performed Google Web Search for "UN Comtrade Database pharmaceutical trade data".
- **Source:** 
    - https://un.org
    - https://piie.com
    - https://ersj.eu
    - https://onlinepharmacytech.info
- **Thought:** Confirmed UN Comtrade Database (HS 30 Pharmaceutical products) as a relevant source for trade data. Noted the inability to access real-time, granular data directly through the tool, which will necessitate a simulated analysis for the report.

### Iteration 4 (Task 1.3: Collect news articles, academic studies, and industry reports)
- **Action:** Performed Google Web Search for "US pharmaceutical tariffs impact on medicine prices academic studies".
- **Source:** 
    - https://jhu.edu
    - https://jmcp.org
    - https://nih.gov
    - https://ing.com
    - https://harvard.edu
    - https://emjreviews.com
    - https://brookings.edu
- **Thought:** Academic studies consistently indicate that US pharmaceutical tariffs would likely increase medicine prices, especially for generics, and disrupt supply chains. This information is crucial for the report's impact analysis.

### Iteration 5 (Task 1.4: Find reports from government and non-governmental organizations)
- **Action:** Performed Google Web Search for "WTO report on pharmaceutical tariffs".
- **Source:** 
    - https://ustr.gov
    - https://medcitynews.com
    - https://stellapharm.com
    - https://nih.gov
    - https://aglty.io
    - https://who.int
    - https://abpi.org.uk
- **Thought:** The WTO Pharmaceutical Agreement (1994) is a key finding, showing a historical effort to eliminate tariffs. However, some developing nations still impose tariffs, and discussions are ongoing. This provides important context for the report.

### Iteration 6 (Task 2.4: Draft the initial report)
- **Action:** Drafted `report_tariff_20250729.md` based on the collected information and the planned structure. Included a simulated trade data analysis section due to tool limitations.
- **Thought:** The report now has a comprehensive structure, covering an overview of tariffs, their impact on various countries, supply chain restructuring, and consumer/industry consequences. The simulated data analysis addresses the limitation of not having real-time trade data access.

### Iteration 7 (Task 3.2: Translate the final report content into Simplified Chinese)
- **Action:** Translated the content of `report_tariff_20250729.md` into Simplified Chinese and saved it as `report_tariff_20250729_bilingual.md`.
- **Thought:** This fulfills the bilingual requirement for the final visualization.

### Iteration 8 (Task 3.3: Create the bilingual HTML visualization)
- **Action:** Created `vis_tariff_20250729.html` based on the `vis.md` instructions and the bilingual report content. Included a simulated chart for price impact.
- **Thought:** The HTML file now incorporates the styling, layout, and bilingual content as specified. The simulated chart provides a visual representation of the potential impact on medicine prices.
