# Report: Impacts of US-EU 15% Tariff Agreement

**Date:** July 28, 2025

## Executive Summary

The recent agreement between the United States and the European Union to implement a 15% tariff on most goods exchanged between the two blocs, effective July 2025, represents a significant shift in transatlantic trade relations. While this agreement averted a more severe trade war with potentially higher tariffs, it is poised to have multifaceted and long-term impacts across various countries and sectors. This report details these impacts, focusing on economic growth, employment, supply chain restructuring, investment flows, and specific effects on key EU member states and industries.

## 1. General Long-Term Impacts

### 1.1. Increased Costs and Prices

The 15% tariff is expected to lead to increased costs for businesses and higher prices for consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US, consumers are likely to see price hikes on imported luxury goods, automobiles, foreign-made leather shoes, handbags, apparel, and electronics. European consumers could face higher prices for US goods if retaliatory tariffs are implemented, and increased competition from redirected products could also influence prices within the EU. Manufacturers in both regions will experience higher input costs for imported raw materials and components, leading to margin pressure.

### 1.2. Economic Growth and Employment

Both the US and EU are projected to experience negative impacts on their GDP and employment, though the 15% tariff agreement aims to mitigate more severe outcomes. 

| Region | Projected GDP Impact (General) | Employment Impact (General) |
|---|---|---|
| **European Union** | Moderately lowered (0.2-0.3% reduction); 0.3% contraction in "no-deal" scenario; 25% US tariff could reduce GDP by 0.33% (short-term) to 0.87% (long-term); full trade war could see 2.5% (short-term) to 1.7% (long-term) decline. | 20% blanket tariff could risk 700,000 jobs; â‚¬160 billion cost (ECB estimate); vulnerable sectors: automotive, manufacturing, steel, chemicals, agriculture; potential production relocation. |
| **United States** | 0.6-1.0% lower GDP from unilateral tariff hikes; 0.7% decline in "no-deal" scenario; 0.2% additional reduction from retaliatory tariffs (combined 1.0% reduction). | Risks to firms/workers relying on international supply chains; SMEs particularly vulnerable; historical job losses from tariffs (e.g., 200,000 jobs from 2002 steel tariffs). |

### 1.3. Supply Chain Restructuring

The 15% tariff, while averting major disruptions from higher rates, will still drive significant supply chain reassessment. Businesses are exploring duty mitigation options and alternative suppliers. This is accelerating a global trend towards more diversified and regionally structured manufacturing networks, reducing reliance on single regions. The US policy aims to bolster domestic industries, encouraging reshoring and localized production. This will lead to shifts in specific sectors, as detailed below.

### 1.4. Investment Flows

The tariff agreement significantly influences investment patterns. The EU has committed to substantial purchases of US energy ($750 billion over three years) and additional investments in US infrastructure and technology ($600 billion through 2030). While tariffs generally deter Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by increasing costs, they can also incentivize foreign companies to invest directly in the tariff-imposing country to bypass trade barriers. The EU also possesses mechanisms, like the Anti-Coercion Instrument, to respond to perceived economic coercion.

## 2. Impacts on Countries

### 2.1. United States

Beyond the general economic impacts of higher consumer prices, reduced GDP, and potential job losses, the US energy sector stands to benefit significantly. The EU's commitment to purchase $750 billion worth of US energy (LNG, oil, nuclear fuels) over three years represents a substantial boost for US energy exports, driven by Europe's strategic shift away from Russian energy sources.

### 2.2. European Union (General)

The EU faces a moderate GDP reduction and a decline in exports to the US. While direct impacts on intra-EU trade are not explicitly detailed, indirect effects from overall economic slowdown, supply chain restructuring, and increased competition from redirected goods are likely. The agreement, despite the tariffs, is seen as bringing some stability compared to a full trade war.

### 2.3. Specific EU Member States

| Country | Key Sector(s) Affected | Impact of 15% Tariff Agreement |
|---|---|---|
| **Germany** | Automotive, Export-oriented economy | The 15% tariff is a significant reduction from previous (27.5%) and threatened (30%) higher tariffs. This is seen as positive, averting substantial losses and indicating a more stable, albeit still tariff-affected, environment for German automakers in the US market. |
| **Ireland** | Pharmaceuticals | The 15% tariff applies broadly, but there's ambiguity and potential for higher future tariffs specifically on pharmaceuticals from the US side. Generic drugs are exempt. The sector is vital to Ireland's economy, and even the 15% tariff is considered a substantial burden, though the agreement provides some certainty. |
| **Italy** | Transport equipment, Fashion, Car manufacturing, Pharmaceuticals, Food, Wine | Highly exposed across several sectors. The 15% tariff, while a burden, provides clarity and avoids a more severe trade conflict. |
| **France** | Aeronautics, Food, Wine, Luxury goods | Less exposed overall than Germany or Italy, but these sectors could still face significant challenges. The agreement avoids the severe impact of previously threatened higher tariff rates. |
| **Netherlands & Belgium** | Goods exports to US (general) | Key markets for US imports from the EU, showing greater exposure in goods exports to the US compared to the overall EU average. The agreement provides much-needed clarity for businesses. |

## 3. Impacts on Key Sectors

### 3.1. Automotive

The 15% tariff on automotive imports from the EU to the US is a significant reduction from previous (25%) and threatened (30%) higher tariffs, aiming to stabilize trade. This will likely lead to higher prices for US consumers and necessitate strategic adjustments for European automakers. The agreement also includes broader EU commitments to US energy and investment.

### 3.2. Pharmaceuticals

The pharmaceutical sector faces a 15% tariff, but there's ongoing ambiguity and potential for higher future tariffs, especially from the US side. Generic drugs are explicitly exempt. The sector is a significant export for the EU to the US, and the 15% tariff is a compromise that avoids previously threatened higher rates, but still represents a new cost.

### 3.3. Steel and Aluminum

The steel and aluminum sectors continue to face a high 50% tariff from the US, which was imposed in June 2025. This is a significant exception to the broader 15% tariff agreement. While the current high tariff remains, there is an indication that it will eventually be replaced by a quota system.

### 3.4. Consumer Goods and Luxury Items

Luxury goods are subject to the 15% tariff, which is a reduction from previously threatened higher rates. This means increased costs for these goods in the US market, but the agreement provides more stability compared to a full trade war.

### 3.5. Energy

The energy sector is a unique case where the 15% tariff agreement has led to a significant increase in EU purchases of US energy (LNG, oil, nuclear fuels), driven by the EU's strategic shift away from Russian sources. This represents a substantial long-term positive impact for the US energy sector, strengthening transatlantic energy ties and enhancing Europe's energy security.

### 3.6. Technology (Semiconductors, Digital Infrastructure)

Semiconductors are subject to the 15% tariff, but semiconductor equipment is exempt. There's still some ambiguity regarding ongoing US investigations into chips. The EU's focus on digital infrastructure and the Digital Markets Act (DMA) are encouraging US investment in European data centers, creating new opportunities in cloud and AI infrastructure.

### 3.7. Defense

The EU is significantly increasing its defense spending, driven by geopolitical factors. A substantial portion of this spending, and a specific commitment within the US-EU trade deal, is directed towards purchasing US military equipment. This indicates a strong and growing market for US defense manufacturers and a continued reliance of the EU on US military technology, despite efforts to bolster its own defense industry.
