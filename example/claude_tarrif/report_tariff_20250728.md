# Deep Research Report: Impacts of US-Euro 15% Tariff Agreement

**Research Date**: July 28, 2025  
**Topic**: Comprehensive analysis of the US-European Union 15% tariff agreement impacts by country, sector, and long-term implications

## Executive Summary

The US-EU 15% tariff agreement, announced on July 27, 2025, represents a significant shift in transatlantic trade relations. This agreement averted a potential 30% tariff rate while establishing a new baseline that is still higher than historical norms. The analysis reveals:

- **Overall Impact**: Moderate negative effects on both economies, with US GDP declining by 0.9-1.0% and EU GDP contracting by 0.3%
- **Country Exposure**: Ireland faces the highest risk (20% of GDP), followed by Italy (4% GDP exposure)
- **Sectoral Effects**: Automotive sector benefits from tariff reduction (27.5% → 15%), while steel/aluminum face continuing high tariffs (50%)
- **Long-term Implications**: Fundamental restructuring of global supply chains and the end of the traditional globalization era

## 8. Conclusion

The US-EU 15% tariff agreement represents a watershed moment in transatlantic economic relations, marking the end of the post-World War II liberal trade order and the beginning of a more fragmented, politically-driven global economy. While the agreement averted the worst-case scenario of 30% tariffs, it still imposes significant costs on both economies and accelerates ongoing supply chain restructuring.

### Key Findings Summary:

1. **Economic Impact**: Moderate but persistent negative effects, with the US bearing higher costs relative to GDP
2. **Country Exposure**: Significant variation within the EU, with Ireland and Italy most vulnerable
3. **Sectoral Differentiation**: Automotive benefits from reduced tariffs, while steel/aluminum face continued pressure
4. **Long-term Transformation**: Fundamental shift toward economic regionalization and reduced global integration

### Strategic Implications:

The agreement establishes a new normal characterized by:
- **Higher Structural Tariffs**: 15% becomes the baseline rather than temporary measure
- **Selective Integration**: Exemptions create complex, politically-negotiated trade flows
- **Supply Chain Regionalization**: Accelerated movement toward political alignment-based trade
- **Innovation Fragmentation**: Reduced cross-Atlantic technology collaboration
- **Geopolitical Realignment**: Weakened transatlantic economic integration with broader strategic implications

The success of economic adjustment will depend on how quickly businesses and governments adapt to this new reality, with early movers in supply chain diversification and market expansion likely to fare better than those assuming a return to pre-2025 trade patterns.
