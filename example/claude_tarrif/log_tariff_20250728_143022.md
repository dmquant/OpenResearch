**What I Do**: 
- Created detailed planning document (planning_tariff_20250728.md)
- Structured research into 6 phases with specific deliverables
- Established success metrics and timeline

**Key Planning Decisions**:
- Focus on major US states and EU countries for country analysis
- Cover manufacturing, agriculture, services, and energy sectors
- Include 3-5 year forward projections
- Target minimum 20 credible sources

### Step 2: Task Creation Phase (14:30:22)
**What I Think**: Need specific, actionable tasks for systematic research execution. Breaking down the broad research plan into concrete steps will ensure comprehensive coverage.

**What I Do**:
- Created task list document (task_tariff_20250728_143022.md)
- Organized tasks by research phase with clear priorities
- Established success criteria for each task

**Next Steps**: Begin background research on current US-EU trade relationship and recent tariff developments.

- Key exemptions: aircraft, chemicals, generic pharmaceuticals, semiconductors

### Step 4: Country-Specific Impact Research (14:40:00)
**What I Think**: Different countries and states will experience varying degrees of impact based on their trade exposure and sectoral composition.

**What I Do**:
- Researched European country exposure levels
- Analyzed US state-level vulnerability patterns

- Germany, France, Netherlands have 3-5% GDP exposure
- California, Texas, Michigan, Ohio face highest US state risks
- 2.6 million US jobs at risk from retaliation

### Step 5: Sectoral Analysis Research (14:45:00)
**What I Think**: Sector-specific impacts will vary significantly based on tariff structures and trade dependencies.

**What I Do**:
- Analyzed automotive sector impacts (25% tariffs → 15% in agreement)

- German Marshall Fund tariff analyses
- Richmond Fed economic impact studies
- Yale Budget Lab tariff tracking

**Key Findings**:
- Automotive: Reduced from 27.5% to 15% tariffs
- Steel/aluminum: 50% tariffs remain unchanged
- Pharmaceuticals: Mixed impact with some exemptions
- Agriculture: EU imposed 25% retaliatory tariffs

### Step 6: Long-term Impact Assessment (14:50:00)
**What I Think**: The 2025 tariff changes represent a fundamental shift in global trade architecture with lasting structural implications.

**What I Do**:
